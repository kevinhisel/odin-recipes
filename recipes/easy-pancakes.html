        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This is a recipe for homemade pancakes. I borrowed it from America's Test Kitchen, and
            I really enjoyed how easy this pancake batter was to put together.</p>
        
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons sugar</li>
            <li>4 teaspoons baking powder</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon baking soda</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>2 large eggs</li>
            <li>1/4 cup vegetable oil</li>
            <li>1 1/2 cups milk</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <h3>Make the batter</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Whisk flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt together in large bowl.</li>
            <li>Whisk eggs and ¼ cup oil in second medium bowl until well combined.</li>
            <li>Whisk milk and vanilla into egg mixture.</li>
            <li>Add egg mixture to flour mixture and stir gently until just combined (batter should 
                remain lumpy with few streaks of flour).</li>
            <li>Let batter sit for 10 minutes before cooking.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Make a test pancake</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat ½ teaspoon oil in 12-inch nonstick skillet over medium-low heat until shimmering.</li>
            <li>Using paper towels, carefully wipe out oil, leaving thin film on bottom and sides of skillet.</li>
            <li>Drop 1 tablespoon batter in center of skillet.</li>
            <li>If pancake is pale golden brown after 1 minute, skillet is ready. If it is too light
                or too dark, adjust heat accordingly.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Cook the pancakes</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Using ¼-cup dry measuring cup, portion batter into skillet in 3 places, leaving 2 
                inches between portions. If necessary, gently spread batter into 4-inch round.</li>
            <li>Cook until edges are set, first sides are golden brown, and bubbles on surface are 
                just beginning to break, 2 to 3 minutes.</li>
            <li>Using thin, wide spatula, flip pancakes and continue to cook until second sides are 
                golden brown, 1 to 2 minutes longer.</li>
            <li>Serve. Repeat with remaining batter, using remaining ½ teaspoon oil as necessary.</li>
        </ol>
