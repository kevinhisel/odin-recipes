        <h2>Description</h2>

            <li>3 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro, divided</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Make the gravy</h3>

            <li>Melt 2 tablespoons butter in large saucepan over medium heat.</li>
            <li>Add onion, garlic, ginger, and serrano and cook, stirring frequently, until

            <li>Add garam masala, coriander, cumin, and pepper and cook, stirring frequently,
                until fragrant, about 3 minutes.</li>

            <li>Add sugar and 1 teaspoon salt and bring to boil.</li>
            <li>Off heat, stir in cream.</li>

            <li>Return sauce to simmer over medium heat and whisk in remaining 2 tablespoons butter.</li>
            <li>Remove saucepan from heat and cover to keep warm. (Sauce can be refrigerated for up
                to 4 days; gently reheat sauce before adding hot chicken.)</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Cook the chicken</h3>

                20 minutes, flipping chicken halfway through broiling.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Combine</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Let chicken rest for 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>While chicken rests, warm sauce over medium-low heat.</li>
